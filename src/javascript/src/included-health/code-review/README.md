# Tic-tac-toe Code Review
The goal of this exercise is to understand how you think about code quality for your team.

You'll be asked to do a code review with a pair of interviewers.

The code is available in several different languages; **please pick the language you are most comfortable with and spend no more than 30 minutes to look over the code prior to your interview.** What would you say to a teammate who wrote this code and asked for your review?
